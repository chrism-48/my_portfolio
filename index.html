    <p id="name_text">Hi, my name is <span id="chris">Chris Moore</span>. This is my portfolio website. I made this so
      that I could
      showcase my projects that I have worked on and tell a little about myself.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text_container2">
    <p class="about_text">I started out my career after graduating from Tri-County Technical College in an injection
      molding plant. At that plant I learned just about everything I could learn as pertains to injection molding. From
      there I stayed in that field from 1992 all the way through 2022. Now, I have enjoyed tinkering with computers over
      the years and I helped friends and family with their computer problems. I would take their laptops and whatever
      and try to fix them. I learned by screwing things up, but fixed a lot of problems. For the last few years, I have
      been working on programming. I learned the basics and started trying to build my own projects. I wished that
      computers would have been more prevalent when I was in school because I believe that is the route I would have
      taken. I did change careers in 2022 and got a computer job working in CAD / Engineering. I want to try to get
      involved in the IT industry doing what I love but I am not sure what path I want take. I really enjoy the design
      part
      of the web. Maybe a front-end developer job will be the route I take. Please go to my Projects page and visit my
      other links to see what I have been working on. </p>
